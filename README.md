KVT
==============

KVT stand for KALRONG Virust Total, this is my first implementation of the Virus Total API on Python, as Im quite new to python this may not be very efficient so please, be patient with me ^^

This script has been tested on python 2.7 so far, remenber that this is still under development an only a few things work.

You will need to create a file with you api keys, the script will use private keys over free ones if both are specified, by default the script will search for a file called api_keys.txt but you can use whatever you want.

Example of api_keys.txt:

free,46e4ac2d7ac1<missing part of the key>1185331138a4c5353

private,none

If several keys from a type appear in the file only the first one will be used. In the future you will be asked to select which key you may want to use.

Im open to suggestions so feel free to get in touch :)

And most of all, thanks for trying my first project!
